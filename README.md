sejda-itext5
============
Implementation of some of the tasks available in Sejda (http://www.sejda.org) using version 5.x of iText (http://itextpdf.com/).

iText is one of the most commonly used PDF manipulation library written in Java. Since version 5.0.0 it's released under two licensing model, a commercial one and a F/OSS one under the [Affero General Public License] v3. 

The sejda-itext5 package is also released under [AGPLv3] license and complies with the iText AGPL license requirements but please note that, **if you want to use it in your application**, then your application too **must comply with the iText AGPL license** or you have to **buy a commercial license**. 

Please refer to the [iText website] for more details.
